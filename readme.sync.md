# Syncing code between two VSTS Projects

This is a quick addon, really not part of the VSTS Neo4j work, but I had a quick need and using the existing VSTS connection info and classes made life easy.

You need to create the default.cfg file, see the readme.md file

Then run SyncRepos.py

You do not need to install Py2Neo for this to work.
